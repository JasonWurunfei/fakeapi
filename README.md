## 0. Intro

This is a REST API backend with fake data design for quick testing purposes or acting as data placeholder for frontend projects.



## 1. setup

1. Create a virtual environment for the project

```cmd
python -m venv env
```
2. Activate it
```cmd
# on Windows
env\Scripts\Activate
```

```sh
# on Mac or Linux
env/bin/Activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```cmd
(env) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> (env) is not part of the command. It's just indicating you are using a virtual environment

4. Start the server

```cmd
python main.py
```
